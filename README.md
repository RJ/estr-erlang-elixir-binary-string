# Use Elixir.String in Erlang (EXPERIMENTAL)

````estr```` is a small erlang wrapper around ````Elixir.String````.

There are some ````Elixir.String*.beam```` files precompiled in ebin/.
These were taken from an Elixir 1.0.2 build. See
https://github.com/elixir-lang

NB: don't run "rebar clean" or you'll lose the Elixir beams.
